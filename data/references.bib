  abstract =  {This report is one of a series on the nomenclature for spectrochemical analysis issued by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. It concerns a new notation for X-ray emission lines and absorption edges, to be called IUPAC Notation, which replaces the existing Siegbahn notation. It is based upon the energy level designation and has the advantage of being simple and easy to apply to any kind of transition. Moreover, it is consistent with the notations used in electron spectroscopy.
The document first discusses the terms currently used in X-ray spectroscopy and then describes the principles of the IUPAC notation with reference to the X-ray levels and the X-ray transitions. The correspondence between Siegbahn and IUPAC notations for all X-ray lines is given in a table. Finally, the document gives the units and conversion factors used in the X-ray range.},
